Spiderboss Firmware
===================

I am not a c++ dev, this code has minimal effort and I only improve/add features
as absolutely needed and even then I do not do much to make the code "better".

## Contributing
Please help make this better if you have experience with embedded cpp experience.

Notice that the environment and tool dependencies are established with the `shell.nix` file
and the `.envrc` file. The only requirements you need to use this are
[direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [nix](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/).

## Testing
Ha! (please help me with this)

## Other notes
When I have some more time I'll learn whats needed to get this repo more
polished until then it is what it is.
